            <br><b>Part 1:</b></br>
            I was born on October 22nd, 2004 in Burnaby, BC. I have two brothers, where I am
            the middle child. My younger brother was born in 2006, while my older brother was born
            in 2001. I have lived in Burnaby for 17 years. While in Burnaby, 
            I went to Elementary and Highschool where I have made friends that I am still close with. Some of my favourite
            memories were hanging out with friends and family. During the summer, we often went
            to Cultus Lake and PNE. I would often go with my family and extended family. My early life can
            be summed up by spending time with my brothers, cousins, and friends. It was fun for the most part, 
            and I made some great memories.

            <br><b>Part 2:</b></br>
            After living in Burnaby for 17 years, I moved to Calgary and lived there for 2 years. 
            I left to study Computer Science at the University of Calgary. During my time in Calgary,
            I got to explore Alberta a bit. I visited Banff and Edmonton. In Edmonton, I visited West Edmonton
            Mall with my family. I also visited Banff twice and got to see Lake Louise. It was fun visiting
            both Edmonton and Banff. Overall, I really enjoyed how peaceful Alberta was and had fun 
            during the 2 years I stayed there.
