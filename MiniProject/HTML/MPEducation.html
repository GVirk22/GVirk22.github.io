            From grade 8-12 I attended Cariboo Hill Secondary. I took all sciences, which were Biology 11/12,
            Chemistry 11/12, and Physics 11/12. I also took Computer Programming 11 where I coded
            with Python. Also, I did some work experience, where I worked in a pharmacy. 
            In total, I worked 40 hours at Shoppers Drugmart Pharmacy in New Westminster. I officially
            graduated in June 2022 with a gold cord.

            I did my first and second year of Computer Science in the University of Calgary.
            While studying there, I worked with Javascript, Python, and Assembly. I also worked 
            with C++, xml, and web developing, but it was a vague introduction.

            After attending the University of Calgary for 2 years, I transferred to SFU. 
            It has been different from UofC in many ways. There are writing courses that were 
            not present in UofC. I learned more philosophical concepts of computing while in SFU. 
            I also learned more about C++, as well as html and web developing.
