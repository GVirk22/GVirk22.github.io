        <p class="aboutMe">
            My name is Gurdit and I was born on October 22nd, 2004. 
            I am 3rd year student currently enrolled in SFU's Computer Science program. 
            Throughout my undergraduate studies, I have worked with many programming languages.
            These languages include Javascript, Python, C++, and Assembly. I have worked on a few projects
            associated with these languages mostly individually, but sometimes collaboratively.
            <br></br>
            My time as an undergraduate student so far has taught me a lot about myself.
            I came into this program with a very minimal knowledge of coding. However, throughout my
            undergraduate studies, I have come to enjoy it. Problem solving is something I have 
            always enjoyed. It is always satisfying to take on a difficult problem and find a solution.
            It also pushes me to learn more as each programming language has different requirements and
            present unique solutions. This is what I like most about Computer Science and why I enjoy coding.
