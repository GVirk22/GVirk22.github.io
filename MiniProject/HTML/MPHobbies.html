            I grew up playing and watching sports. In my spare time, I enjoy playing sports.
            I used to play Ball Hockey on a team when I was much younger. Also, used to play
            Soccer and Basketball with my cousins a lot. Now I mostly play Basketball and Hockey
            with friends and family for fun. I also grew up watching sports and have been
            a lifelong Hockey fan. I grew up watching the Canucks only, but now I have been
            watching other sports. Now I have started to watch Hockey, Basketball, Football, 
            and Baseball.

            I grew up listening to music. I only really listened to Rap and R&B growing up. However, now I listen to
            many different types of music. I still listen to Rap and R&B mainly, but not exclusively. There are many artists
            I still listen to from when I was younger and many new ones I listen to.

            As a kid, I often watched cartoons on Teletoon and Disney Channel. As I got older, I started watching more shows on Netflix.
            I watched many shows on Netflix, but my favourite show of all time is Breaking Bad.
